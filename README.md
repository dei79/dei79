### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an experienced CTO focused on Workspace Management and Cloud Transformation; my passion is to enable tech teams to leverage disruptive technologies to build simple-to-use products.

I'm excited to work on innovations and products, bringing technology's customer value to the surface and making them more valuable. Recurrent re-iterating all phases of a product lifecycle - Strategy, Design, and Execution - is an enjoyable part of this journey.

Within Matrix42, we help organizations digitize the workspace environment of their employees. I'm proud to be part of the team building the software for a digital workspace experience that manages devices, applications, processes, and services that are simple, secure, and compliant.

I love acting as Public Speaker in that industry to let as many as possible participate in changing IT works! 

Should a CTO write code? At least, I do so enjoy my personal preferences:
